# DSA (Data structures & Algorithms) Learning

This repository contains multiple implementations of data structures and algorithms in C (and potentially in OCaml in the future). It serves as a record of my progress, in case I need to reference it, and could be useful for anyone interested in learning data structures and algorithms.

For each data structure or algorithm, you will find a list of three LeetCode exercises (Easy-Medium-Hard) and one exercise that demonstrates a real use case of this data structure/algorithm. Please note that these exercises were generated with ChatGPT; hence, some of them might not be relevant.
