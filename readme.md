# DSA (Data structures & Algorithms) Learning

This repository contains multiple implementations of data structures and algorithms in C (and maybe in OCaml in the future).<br>
This repository acts as a record of my progression in case I need to reference it and could be useful for anyone who wants to learn data structures and algorithms.
