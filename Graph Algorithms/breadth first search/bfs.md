## Actual application exercise

Title: Shortest Path in Network Routing <br>
Statement: You are working on a network routing application, where you need to find the shortest path between two nodes in a network. Each node represents a router, and each edge represents a link between routers with an associated cost (e.g., latency, bandwidth). Implement a program in C to read the network topology and find the shortest path between a given source and destination router using Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
